# Care for Children and Youth With Mental Disorders

This repository contains cleaned, analysis-ready datasets derived from CIHI tables about mental-health-related care for children and youth (ages 5–24). The datasets summarize emergency department visits, hospitalizations, physician visits, and dispensed psychotropic medications, and include breakdowns by province/territory, age group, sex, income, and residence type.

The processed CSVs are provided to support visualization and reporting—they are formatted for easy import into tools such as Tableau to build dashboards and interactive reports.

If you need the original processing script or want help preparing specific visualizations, open an issue or get in touch.
